Lab 1:
Score:

Introduction = 1/1
Procedure = 2/2
Data = 3.5/5
Questions = 0/0
Conclusion = 0/2

Structure Loss = 0
On Time = 0.5

Total score = (Introduction + Procedure + Data + Questions + Conclusion + Structure Loss) * On Time = 3.25/10

Comments:

Data:
Method used to identify pi value is wrong. To find pi plot the graph of circumference vs diameter. Add the trend line that crosses zero. Slope of the trend line is the pi value
Conclusion:
Main result is not presented or reasons for it being right or wrong are not discussed
Main result needs to be presented similar to:
We measured g = 9.5 m/s^2, known table value is 9.81 m/s^2, our result has an error of 3.1%.
Ways to improve experiment setup were not suggested.
Suggest specific ways how to improve experiment (less vague than doing more repetitions or using more precise equipment)




Lab 2:

Conclusion = 1/2

Structure Loss = 0
On Time = 1

Total score = (Introduction + Procedure + Data + Questions + Conclusion + Structure Loss) * On Time = 7/10

Comments:

Data:
Direction to point the plane to stay on course is not calculated correctly
In order to stay on the northbound course, pilot needs to have a velocity directed NW in such manner, that X component of her velocity is equal to the X component of the wind to cancel each other. Therefore, the angle can be found using equation
Vx = V cos(tetta) = -w
Or
tetta = arccos(-w/V) = 1.88 rad = 108 degrees
Or, in case of the confusion, 18 degrees from North
Conclusion:
Main result is not presented or reasons for it being right or wrong are not discussed
Main result needs to be presented similar to:
We measured g = 9.5 m/s^2, known table value is 9.81 m/s^2, our result has an error of 3.1%.
