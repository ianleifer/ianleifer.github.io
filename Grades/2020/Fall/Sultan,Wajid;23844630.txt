Procedure:
Procedure has to be structured using lab guidelines. Each big experiment has to be clearly identified and then steps to perform that experiment should be shown as a list i.e.
Experiment 1:
1) …
2) …
…
Data:
Resultant force is not calculated correctly
You needed to take
Rx = V1x+V2x and Ry = V1y + V2y
And then calculate
R = (Rx^2+Ry^2)^(1/2)
tetta = arctan(Ry/Rx)
Equilibrant force is not calculated correctly
You needed to take resultant force R, tettaR and put
E = R
tettaE = tettaR – 180
Resultant direction and speed are calculated correctly
Resultant can be found using aircraft speed (V) and wind speed (w)
R = (V^2 + w^2)^(1/2) = (210^2+65^2)^(1/2) = 219.8 km/h
Tetta = arctan(V/w) = 1.27 rad = 72.8 degrees
Direction to point the plane to stay on course is not calculated correctly
In order to stay on the northbound course, pilot needs to have a velocity directed NW in such manner, that X component of her velocity is equal to the X component of the wind to cancel each other. Therefore, the angle can be found using equation
Vx = V cos(tetta) = -w
Or
tetta = arccos(-w/V) = 1.88 rad = 108 degrees
Or, in case of the confusion, 18 degrees from North
Conclusion:
Main result is not presented or reasons for it being right or wrong are not discussed
Main result needs to be presented similar to:
We measured g = 9.5 m/s^2, known table value is 9.81 m/s^2, our result has an error of 3.1%.
Ways to improve experiment setup were not suggested.
Suggest specific ways how to improve experiment (less vague than doing more repetitions or using more precise equipment)
