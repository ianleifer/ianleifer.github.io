Lab 1:
Score:

Introduction = 1/1
Procedure = 1/2
Data = 3.5/5
Questions = 0/0
Conclusion = 1/2

Structure Loss = -2
On Time = 1

Total score = (Introduction + Procedure + Data + Questions + Conclusion + Structure Loss) * On Time = 4.5/10

Comments:

Procedure:
Procedure has to be structured using lab guidelines. Each big experiment has to be clearly identified and then steps to perform that experiment should be shown as a list i.e.
Experiment 1:
1) …
2) …
…
Data:
Method used to identify pi value is wrong. To find pi plot the graph of circumference vs diameter. Add the trend line that crosses zero. Slope of the trend line is the pi value
Conclusion:
Ways to improve experiment setup were not suggested.
Suggest specific ways how to improve experiment (less vague than doing more repetitions or using more precise equipment)

Comments:

Data:
Equilibrant force is not calculated correctly
You needed to take resultant force R, tettaR and put
E = R
tettaE = tettaR – 180
Direction to point the plane to stay on course is not calculated correctly
In order to stay on the northbound course, pilot needs to have a velocity directed NW in such manner, that X component of her velocity is equal to the X component of the wind to cancel each other. Therefore, the angle can be found using equation
Vx = V cos(tetta) = -w
Or
tetta = arccos(-w/V) = 1.88 rad = 108 degrees
Or, in case of the confusion, 18 degrees from North
Conclusion:
Main result is not presented or reasons for it being right or wrong are not discussed
Main result needs to be presented similar to:
We measured g = 9.5 m/s^2, known table value is 9.81 m/s^2, our result has an error of 3.1%.
Ways to improve experiment setup were not suggested.

Comments:

Procedure:

Data:
Measurements from the part 1 are not present
Conclusion:
Main result is not presented or reasons for it being right or wrong are not discussed
Main result needs to be presented similar to:
We measured g = 9.5 m/s^2, known table value is 9.81 m/s^2, our result has an error of 3.1%.
