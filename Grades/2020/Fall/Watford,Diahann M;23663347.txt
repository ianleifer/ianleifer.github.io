Lab 1:
Score:

Introduction = 1/1
Procedure = 1/2
Data = 3.5/5
Questions = 0/0
Conclusion = 1/2

Structure Loss = 0
On Time = 1

Total score = (Introduction + Procedure + Data + Questions + Conclusion + Structure Loss) * On Time = 6.5/10

Comments:

Procedure:
Procedure has to be structured using lab guidelines. Each big experiment has to be clearly identified and then steps to perform that experiment should be shown as a list i.e.
Experiment 1:
1) …
2) …
…
Data:
Time in between heartbeats measurement is not presented
Average rate of walking is not calculated or is clearly wrong
Conclusion:
Ways to improve experiment setup were not suggested.
Suggest specific ways how to improve experiment (less vague than doing more repetitions or using more precise equipment)

Resultant force is not calculated correctly
You needed to take
Rx = V1x+V2x and Ry = V1y + V2y
And then calculate
R = (Rx^2+Ry^2)^(1/2)
tetta = arctan(Ry/Rx)
Equilibrant force is not calculated correctly
You needed to take resultant force R, tettaR and put
E = R
tettaE = tettaR – 180
Resultant direction and speed are calculated correctly
Resultant can be found using aircraft speed (V) and wind speed (w)
R = (V^2 + w^2)^(1/2) = (210^2+65^2)^(1/2) = 219.8 km/h
Tetta = arctan(V/w) = 1.27 rad = 72.8 degrees
Direction to point the plane to stay on course is not calculated correctly
In order to stay on the northbound course, pilot needs to have a velocity directed NW in such manner, that X component of her velocity is equal to the X component of the wind to cancel each other. Therefore, the angle can be found using equation
Vx = V cos(tetta) = -w
Or
tetta = arccos(-w/V) = 1.88 rad = 108 degrees
Or, in case of the confusion, 18 degrees from North
Corrective measures when landing not stated
During landing the pilot would have to turn her plane further west, because while the speed is going to be decreasing X component of it is also going to decrease, so in order to stay on northbound course, she will need to turn further west.

Ways to improve experiment setup were not suggested.
