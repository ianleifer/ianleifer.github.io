Data:
Summary table with the data for the part 2a is not present or doesn’t have all the measurements
Plot m vs V for the part 2a is not present
Summary table with the data for the part 2b is not present or doesn’t have all the measurements
Plot r vs w for the part 2b is present
Conclusion:
Main result is not presented or reasons for it being right or wrong are not discussed
Main result needs to be presented similar to:
We measured g = 9.5 m/s^2, known table value is 9.81 m/s^2, our result has an error of 3.1%.
Ways to improve experiment setup were not suggested.
Suggest specific ways how to improve experiment (less vague than doing more repetitions or using more precise equipment)
