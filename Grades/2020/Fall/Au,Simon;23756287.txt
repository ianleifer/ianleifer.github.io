Comments:

Data:
Direction to point the plane to stay on course is not calculated correctly
In order to stay on the northbound course, pilot needs to have a velocity directed NW in such manner, that X component of her velocity is equal to the X component of the wind to cancel each other. Therefore, the angle can be found using equation
Vx = V cos(tetta) = -w
Or
tetta = arccos(-w/V) = 1.88 rad = 108 degrees
Or, in case of the confusion, 18 degrees from North
Conclusion:
Ways to improve experiment setup were not suggested.
Suggest specific ways how to improve experiment (less vague than doing more repetitions or using more precise equipment)

Comments:

Data:
Summary table with the data for the part 2a is not present or doesn’t have all the measurements
Plot m vs V for the part 2a is not present
Summary table with the data for the part 2b is not present or doesn’t have all the measurements
Plot r vs w for the part 2b is present
Conclusion:
Main result is not presented or reasons for it being right or wrong are not discussed
Main result needs to be presented similar to:
We measured g = 9.5 m/s^2, known table value is 9.81 m/s^2, our result has an error of 3.1%.
