Lab 1:
Score:

Introduction = 1/1
Procedure = 2/2
Data = 2.5/5
Questions = 0/0
Conclusion = 0/2

Structure Loss = 0
On Time = 1

Total score = (Introduction + Procedure + Data + Questions + Conclusion + Structure Loss) * On Time = 5.5/10

Comments:

Data:
Method used to identify pi value is wrong. To find pi plot the graph of circumference vs diameter. Add the trend line that crosses zero. Slope of the trend line is the pi value
Average rate of walking is not calculated or is clearly wrong
Conclusion:
Main result is not presented or reasons for it being right or wrong are not discussed
Main result needs to be presented similar to:
We measured g = 9.5 m/s^2, known table value is 9.81 m/s^2, our result has an error of 3.1%.
Ways to improve experiment setup were not suggested.
Suggest specific ways how to improve experiment (less vague than doing more repetitions or using more precise equipment)




Lab 2:

Data = 5/5
Questions = 0/0
Conclusion = 2/2

Structure Loss = NaN
On Time = NaN

Total score = (Introduction + Procedure + Data + Questions + Conclusion + Structure Loss) * On Time = NaN/10

Comments:

Procedure:
All experiments that were conducted during the lab need to be described in the procedure
Data:
Measurements from the part 1 are not present
Summary table with the data for the part 2a is not present or doesnâ€™t have all the measurements
Plot m vs V for the part 2a is not present
Plot r vs w for the part 2b is present
Conclusion:
Main result is not presented or reasons for it being right or wrong are not discussed
Main result needs to be presented similar to:
We measured g = 9.5 m/s^2, known table value is 9.81 m/s^2, our result has an error of 3.1%.
