Procedure:
Procedure has to be structured using lab guidelines. Each big experiment has to be clearly identified and then steps to perform that experiment should be shown as a list i.e.
Experiment 1:
1) …
2) …
…
Data:
Time in between heartbeats measurement is not presented
Conclusion:
Main result is not presented or reasons for it being right or wrong are not discussed
Main result needs to be presented similar to:
We measured g = 9.5 m/s^2, known table value is 9.81 m/s^2, our result has an error of 3.1%.
Ways to improve experiment setup were not suggested.
Suggest specific ways how to improve experiment (less vague than doing more repetitions or using more precise equipment)
